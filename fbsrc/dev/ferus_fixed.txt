Ferus boss sequence:
When we enter the boss chamber, the door closes behind us. Lynn takes two steps forward. Music fades. There is a massive door at the top of the room, currently closed with huge bars and off-camera. There is a pause, then we hear the telltale mechanical sounds of the small creature approaching. They stop for a moment... Pan up to the door at the top of the room. Then the bars on the door open. Ferus walks onto the screen from the door, still looking like the (tiny) strange cross between a fox and a ferret. (camera follows it) It stops in the center of the room, and the screen flickers white a few times rapidly with a garbled mechanical sound. The screen fades up to white, and as it fades back down, Ferus is in its true form, a huge bio-mechanical beast. Lynn walks up to it until she is facing it, one tile away.
“Lynn: Holographics…!”
There is a strange mechanical beeping noise.
“Ferus: Translation error”
“Lynn: What…?”
“Ferus: I will lead you to your pod. Please comply.”
Lynn backs up a step.
“Ferus: My orders are for your own good. Follow me and find happiness.”
“Lynn: …No!”
“Ferus: I will lead you to your pod. Please comply.”
Lynn walks forward a step.
“Lynn: I said--”
“Ferus: I will lead you to your pod. Please comply.”
Lynn walks right up to Ferus and swings the Divius Star at it.
Lynn takes a step back as Ferus advances.
“Ferus: My orders are for your own good. Follow me and find happiness.”
“Lynn: Stop! I won’t be a part of your system!”
There is a strange mechanical beeping noise.
“Ferus: Translation error”
“Ferus: Follow me and find happiness.”
Ferus advances once more, and Lynn continues to back up.
“Ferus: Follow me and find happiness.”
“Lynn: I won’t!”
Ferus advances a final time.
“Ferus: Follow me and find--”
Lynn, cornered, swings at Ferus again, this time executing a Rage attack (white flash). An explosion goes off over Ferus. It backs up slightly.
“Ferus: Hostility detected.”
“Lynn: Damn right… Back off. You’re too stupid to know the consequences of the mindless actions they built into you. You don’t even know what happiness is.”
There is a strange mechanical beeping noise, again.
“Ferus: Translation error”
"Lynn: ..."
“Ferus: Countermeasures.”
The boss fight begins. (boss music: boss)
