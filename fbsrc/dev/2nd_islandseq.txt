Lynn stands at 24/18 (tile), with one archaeologist a few tiles to the left of her (by the blue pod), and a few more of them to the right walking around.

“So this is the island, huh? …Strange. I didn’t think it would look so… surreal…”

The archaeologist on the left walks up to her.

“Well, this is uncharted land. You never know what you’ll find, but personally, I don’t think it’s…”

Lynn turns away.

“Yeah, yeah. Spare me your crazy theories. Where’s this item I’m supposed to escort back?”

“You will see it soon.”

Lynn turns back to the archaeologist and walks up to him.
“What else do you hope to find here, anyway? You’ve found what you came for.”

“We don’t know what else there is to find here… There could be more caverns, more artifacts. We can’t risk leaving them behind if more exist.”
Lynn walks away, to stand by the shoreline.
“Just remember that you’re paying me by the hour for my services.”

Fade up to white again, then down to a different part* of the same island. Several archaeologists are gathered around a crate. Lynn stands nearby, again.
One of the archaeologists approaches the crate.
Lynn walks up to the crate, and the archaeologist steps aside.

“Is this what you want me to escort back? I assume it will be carried on a separate Wyvern Ray?”

“Of course.”

“Good—Then let’s go. I don’t like this place…”

*On the 'different part' of the island in this same sequence, the crate is 8px down and right of the tile 30/11. (in the middle of the 'metal' looking patch of ground) Lynn stands a couple tiles below it, and some archaeologists are on either side.

final island sequence:
Moth2 stands at 30/28. Lynn stands at 32/28.
