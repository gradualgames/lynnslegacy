The health salesman (healthmonger.spr) wanders around with normal NPC ai. Upon talking to him, the following occurs:

"Salesman: Traveller! Looks like you would do well to be in a bit better shape... I've got just the thing."

"Your current health is [current health]."

"Upgrate to [1 more than current health] for 100 gold?"

(note: the price goes up by 5 gold each time. So the first time it's 100, after that it's 105, then 110, etc etc)

At the bottom of the "Upgrate to [1 more than current health] for 100 gold?" text box (one box after it if there isn't room), there are two options; Yes and No, lined up horizontally. Both are the normal text color, but when they're highlighted they're white.

Upon choosing yes:

"Salesman: Heh, heh... Thank you."

"Your health has increased by one point!"

Upon choosing no:

"Salesman: Too bad. You know where to find me..."

Once we have maximum health and talk to him:

"Salesman: I can't help you anymore, so stop hangin' around! It's bad for business."

If we try to buy but don't have the cash:

"Salesman: Looks like you're a little short on gold. Come back when you can afford what I've got."
