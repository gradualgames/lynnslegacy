1: \ldblquote First sector of year 6765, Precision 20. Master Seminus assures us it\rquote s nothing, but I can\rquote t help but worry at the strange noises we keep hearing during the night. They\rquote re like nothing I\rquote ve ever heard, and though they seem to be fairly distant, I don\rquote t think I\rquote d like to stumble upon the creature that may produce them\'85 Apart from these strange sounds, the dimension of Moenia seems to be fairly stable, if bland. If there are no further threats it may be suitable for population\'85\rdblquote\par
\par
2: \ldblquote First sector of year 6765, Precision 21. Today we came across a most peculiar finding\'85 some sort of strange animal corpse, about the size of a dog but much more bat-like than Canine. However, the strangest thing about it was its unusually large skull and its set of four leathery wings. It appeared to have been dead for quite some time, and several large burn marks were visible on its side. Delmeir and Master Einer have returned to Logosta with the corpse in tow.\rdblquote\par
\par
3: \ldblquote First sector of year 6765, Precision 21. Disaster has struck\'85 we were attacked recently by a pack of the strange bat-like creatures identical to the corpse we discovered earlier. While most of them went for us, I did notice some infighting. They were scattered when an exceptionally large specimen arrived amongst them and began attacking its own kind with exceptional vigor. It seemed to produce some sort of flammable substance from a cavity in its skull, which would explain the burn marks that were noted on the first corpse we came upon\'85 Master Seminus has declared the expedition a failure, and we are to return to Logosta soon. A few of our men have christened the large bat creature \lquote Grult.\rquote\rdblquote\par
\par
4: \ldblquote First sector of year 6765, Precision 24. Already I doubt my ability to complete this note before the end, but to anyone who may come upon this dimension in the future\emdash The strange species of bat-creatures are not accustomed to excessive light, and are weak in its presence. As such we have built various makeshift torches throughout our path to aid travel through this condemned dimension. I must conclude this note now, for already I can hear the creatures advancing. They have blocked the portal off, and by now I fear it has already burnt itself out\'85 I doubt there is any way out of here, now. Perhaps the only hope I have is that eventually Grult will destroy the rest of his kin so that we may only have him to deal with\'85\rdblquote\par

Gelidus \lquote chronicles\rquote\par
\par
1: \ldblquote Third sector of year 6765, Precision unknown. Precision 1 of the Gelidus expedition: Arrival. Gelidus\emdash What a wonderful dimension! Everywhere I see light reflecting off the shining walls of ice, glittering in our torchlight and inspiring us to delve further\'85 Only a few hostile races have been encountered so far, but they have been no problem for us. Though we must remember not to go rampantly killing every creature we meet upon the first sign of hostility\'85 lest we repeat our past mistakes in our own world.\rdblquote\par
\par
2: \ldblquote Third sector of year 6765, Precision unknown. Precision 2 of the Gelidus expedition: Pondering. The beauty of this dimension has faded slightly, though it still manages to capture our attention from time to time. It grows colder the farther we go\'85 I have a feeling it may not be such a wise choice after all.\rdblquote\par
\par
3: \ldblquote Third sector of year 6765, Precision unknown. Precision 3 of the Gelidus expedition: Discoveries. We have encountered a new hostile race. Christened the Ice Striders, they are small crustaceans that seem to use the ice as a means of transportation, sliding across it in the direction they wish to go. The larger specimens seem to have some sort of reflection system to concentrate the natural light of the dimension into saturated forms\'85 While not all of them have been hostile thus far, they have been classified as a possible threat.\rdblquote\par
\par
4: \ldblquote Third sector of year 6765, Precision unknown. Precision 4 of the Gelidus expedition. Cold. It grows colder by the minute. I think now more than ever that this dimension is nothing but a Siren\rquote s call. Its natural beauty is far surpassed by its unlivable temperature.\rdblquote\par
\par
5: \ldblquote Third sector of year 6765, Precision unknown. Precision 5 of the Gelidus expedition: Return. The decision has been made. We are to return to Logosta soon\'85 Most of our supplies have been frozen, and there is no use taking them back with us. Many of the pages in my journals have frozen together by now\'85 I don\rquote t see much point in bringing them back either. Over the past few days I have been dropping various supplies to lighten the load upon my shoulders; perhaps some of the journals as well. At the moment I can\rquote t seem to care much. I just need to get back\'85\rdblquote\par

Ignia \lquote chronicles\rquote\par
\par
1: \ldblquote First precision\'85 Ive decided to keep a journal during this expidition. Master Semminous and the others say I shoudnt bother, as im a geologist and not a language master, and that I shoud stick to what I do best, but i dont mind. (Master Semminous says I shoud at least learn to spell his name right first, but i figured since I dont plan on showing this to anyone I shoudnt bother as long as i can understand it)\rdblquote\par
\par
2: \ldblquote Second precision\'85 Well, theyve already decided that this dimension isnt suitable for life, its too hot, but were gonna collect some rock samples anyway. Were almost done, we leave for Logosta in a few hours.\rdblquote\par
\line 3: \ldblquote Third precision\'85 been some weird sightings of some kinda gost lately\'85 they say he controlls the fire around him and that he can go anywere he wants, real quick like\'85 I dunno if i believe the rumers myself, but if their true then I think we best get out of here fast\'85\rdblquote\par

Arx \lquote chronicles\rquote\par
\par
1: \ldblquote Arx expedition, Fourth sector of year 6765, Precision 57. We have named this dimension \lquote Arx.\rquote  It appears to be one massive fortress, or at least we can\rquote t find a way beyond these walls\'85 a very interesting case. I have stumbled upon what appear to be some sort of religious texts,  always referring to a \lquote true leader\rquote\emdash I have yet to translate them fully, but I shall be sure to copy them down when I do.\rdblquote\par
\par
2: \ldblquote Arx expedition, Fourth sector of year 6765, Precision 58. Came across some armor-clad humanoid beings today. They never spoke a word, and of course we could not see what was beneath the armor\'85 Some seemed hostile, and others were simply content to wander the area mindlessly.\rdblquote\par
\par
3: \ldblquote Arx expedition, Fourth sector of year 6765, Precision 59. I have translated some of the previously mentioned texts. Here is an excerpt: \lquote\'85And if one should attempt to reverse the blessing to serve himself, \lquote twill be severed, and the accursed shall rot without dignity for rest of his days.\rquote  The \lquote blessing\rquote  of which it speaks is a curious thing\'85 apparently it is some sort of \lquote spell\rquote  or curse which binds someone to eternally serve this \lquote true leader.\rquote\rdblquote\par
\par
4: \ldblquote Arx expedition, Fourth sector of year 6765, Precision 60. We have come across an armory. All it seems to contain is a myriad of large swords, and rows and rows of identical armor\'85\rdblquote\par
\par
5: \ldblquote Arx expedition, Fourth sector of year 6765, Precision 61. We have all begun to feel it\'85 some sort of slight paranoia, perhaps? Something in the air. I do not believe we are alone with these mindless drones.\rdblquote\par
\par
6: \ldblquote Arx expedition, Fifth sector of year 6765, Precision 1. A large man clad in magnificent green armor appeared before us all today and introduced himself as \lquote Sir Sterach, true leader of The Fortress.\rquote  As he stood among us we were gripped by an overwhelming sense of awe\'85 and then he bestowed upon us what he referred to as \lquote a divine blessing.\rquote  Suddenly my mind seemed\'85clear.\rdblquote\par
\par
7: \ldblquote  Arx expedition, Fifth sector of year 6765, Precision 2. Some of our men have become increasingly absent-minded. Some wander about mindlessly just like the armor-clad drones, and some have apparently disappeared. I returned to the armory earlier to find several suits of armor missing.\rdblquote\par
\par
8: \ldblquote Fifth sector of year 6765, Precision 3\'85 Some of us have apparently resisted this blessing that has been bestowed upon us. Sir Sterach must have known, for immediately he appeared among us and set upon the would-be traitors with amazing combat prowess. He used a peculiar style of fighting, which involved the throwing (and subsequent recalling) of his own sword.\rdblquote\par
\par
9: \ldblquote Precision\'85 4? 5? Unknown\'85 Looking back on my previous entries, I don\rquote t seem to recall any of the events described, with a few exceptions\'85 yet I do not seem worried. The True Leader has appeared in my dreams many times to tell me that I am doing well\'85 He wishes to see me in the armory later today.\rdblquote\par

Nerme \lquote chronicles\rquote\par
\par
1: \ldblquote 6765, Sixth sector, Precision 18: The dimension of Nerme\'85 Very different from most of the others, and hopefully more successful. It does not seem to be a victim of the extreme temperatures that both Gelidus and Ignia suffered from, and it does appear to be more natural. Grass and various plants are everywhere, growing on the walls in such a manner as to completely obscure the natural grayish rock with a thick blanket of lush green foliage. Delmeir has mostly kept to himself, as geology (his field of expertise) does not relate much to this expedition. However, he has been dutifully taking notes on whatever minerals he happens to come across. For the most part, they are\'85 interesting, but as he says himself, he has never been much of a language master.\rdblquote\par
\par
2: \ldblquote 6765, Sixth sector, Precision 22: We have found what appears to be indications of a now-lost primitive civilization\'85 faint scratching on what portions of wall we have uncovered, and the occasional tool and basic structure. This has become the primary area of research, and at the moment we are all struggling to discover what could have caused the civilization to be wiped out, as we have found no recent signs of intelligent life.\rdblquote\par
\par
3: \ldblquote 6765, Sixth sector, Precision 30: Plants\'85 We should have expected something like this, having found no truly intelligent life so far. Shortly after discovering a strange visage embedded in a foliage-plated wall, we realized that it, and much of the plant life around us, was indeed sentient. They must have been employing stealth before, for now they seem much more sensitive and while not completely hostile as of yet, are very cautious.\rdblquote\par
\par
4: \ldblquote 6765, Sixth sector, Precision 31: Theories have been arising lately about what could have caused the fall of the primitive civilization whose traces we came across earlier. The most popular one seems to be that these sentient plants somehow waged a war against them. This is considered all the more likely after a recent discovery\'85 All of us saw it. A lone man, or at least humanoid, covered in a plant-like carapace wandering about aimlessly, and emitting strange scraping noises from what must have been its throat. None of us are sure if it is natural or some kind of parasite infestation taken to the extreme\'85 But the signs of the civilization were quite old, and it simply goes against the laws of nature to think that a deceased human body could be kept alive for so long, even as a host to some kind of parasite.\rdblquote\par
\par
5: \ldblquote 6765, Sixth sector, Precision 18: This dimension becomes more hellish with each passing day. Seeing that it was wholly unfit for population, we attempted to return to the portal, only find it\'85 for lack of a better word, consumed. It seems that the plant life throughout this world has somehow grown over the portal and harnessed its power\'85 and always, it grows. Already it has begun to take shape, congealing the portal into a reflective crystal-like mass, constantly fed by the pulsating light of several bizarre tree-like entities embedded in the walls. Some of us have theorized that in this way, the dimension is feeding itself, creating more rampant plant matter to populate its chambers with.\rdblquote\par

Divius \lquote chronicles\rquote\par
\par
1: \ldblquote (This book appears to have been burnt, and is completely unreadable.)\rdblquote\par
\par
2: \ldblquote We\rquote ve trapped the God! At last, we have managed to neutralize most of its power\'85 It now lies within the hard shell of a blessed statue, with only its most minimal powers remaining. It should be no threat unless someone should wander within its proximity\'85\rdblquote\par
\par
3: \ldblquote It seems we were mistaken. Apparently the God, Divine, can still summon his underlings at will. As such, this dimension has become dangerous once more\'85 We have given up all salvation efforts and plan to return to Logosta soon.\rdblquote\par
\par
3: \ldblquote (Most of this book is illegible due to burning, but a few lines are still apparent.) \'85from our experiments, detests the cold. It\rquote s not fatal, but it may serve to weaken\'85\rdblquote\par
