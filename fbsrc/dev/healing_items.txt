The blue chest with the adrenaline booster is at 19/16 in l_lab, room 0. When we get it:

"Found the Adrenaline Booster!"

"Use this to do double the damage you do, but lose three health as a side effect. The Adrenaline Meter will also be disabled for the duration."

When used, the screen flashes white and the adrenaline meter disappears. When the adrenaline ends, the meter reappears.






The blue chest with the healing symbol in it is at 26/16 (intentionally difficult to spot) in room 3 of valley.map. When we get it:

"Found the Healing Symbol!"

"Use this item to regenerate one health point at the cost of one gold."

When used, heal.spr (same size as Lynn) is displayed over lynn and a healing sound is played-- I'll make and send the sound soon
