Setting up bridges:

First, set up a button.

Add one sequence.

Add one entity.
Set it to "give orders to" the number of the button.
(Will say - Enemy[x] above it, so you can see)

Add one command.

Add one block.

Set "Func" to 2.
Set chap to an "open event number"

(NOTE: follow dungeon numbering conventions;
moenia = 100 - 199, gelidus = 200 - 299, ignia = 300 - 399, etc...)

Now, go to "Spawn..." for the button, Click "Conditional" to make it say yes.

Change # of kills to 1

Index: "open event number"
State: 1



Now, the bridge is easy, just place it where you want

Modify "Spawn..."

# of waits = 1

Index: "open event number"
State: 1

(NOTE: This must be done for ALL bridge "tiles")
