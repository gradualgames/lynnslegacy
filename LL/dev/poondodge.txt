when we enter the house, poondodge speaks: (this scene only plays once)
"Man: Welcome! My name's Poondodge."
"Lynn: ...Poondodge?"
"Poondodge: Yup! I'm a tailor. Feel free to look around."
"Poondodge: Just examine whatever item you want to know more about!"

text for when we examine each outfit:

cat suit:
"Poondodge: This is one of my favorites. It'll get you where you wanna go, and fast!"

ninja suit: (incomplete)
"Poondodge: I haven't finished this one yet... It's made of a special kind of silk, and I'm fresh out."

ninja suit: (complete)
"Poondodge: In combat, you have to be quick. This outfit should give you a helping hand in that area... I'll give it to you for free since you helped me out."

lynnity:
"Poondodge: You'll feel great wearing this one. It really gets the adrenaline flowing!"

swimsuit:
"Poondodge: Um... I don't care much for this one. It was requested by a friend of mine, actually. It doesn't have much use as far as I can tell."

red knight:
"Poondodge: This one's too heavy to move very fast in, let alone swing your weapon... But just a few minutes in this suit will leave you feeling great."

when we examine the ninja suit once we have the evernight silk:
"Poondodge: Hey, is that Evernight Silk? Great! I can finally finish this outfit!"
