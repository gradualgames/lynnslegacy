When we talk to the 'suicide guard': (he stands on the edge of the ledge as the first frame of suicide_guard.spr. It's placed two tiles to the left of the end of the ledge)

"Soldier: ..."
"Lynn: ...Hello?"
"Soldier: ... ..."
"Lynn: (I can't make out what he's trying to say)"
"Soldier: ...Turned them into drones..."
"Lynn: He's nuts. I don't have time for this."
Lynn turns away and takes a couple steps towards the door.
"Soldier: DON'T LEAVE!"
Lynn turns (but doesn't walk) back towards him.
"Soldier: I don't want to talk to myself anymore..."
"Lynn: ...What?"
"Soldier: I have to hide from them, but I remember what every one of them used to be like... I remember their faces."
"Lynn: You're not like them, are you?"
"Soldier: I knew them. When we first came to this place, trying to find a new home..."
"Soldier: I can't watch them any longer. They're only shells now."
"Soldier: Logosta, forgive me..."
Lynn walks towards him again.
"Lynn: Wait!"
The Soldier lets himself fall off the ledge. (the rest of the suicide_guard.spr anim)
"Lynn: ...I'm just as lost here as he was."
