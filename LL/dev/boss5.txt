The Rot Tree dwells in a room that is roughly shaped like a +, with the doorway through which we enter in the bottom 'arm', and tree faces in all the other arms. (eg. boss5_down is the donward-facing tree in the upper arm, boss5_left is the left-facing tree in the right arm, etc)

In the middle of the room there is a blue crystal (boss5_crystal). Each of the faces shoots a beam towards the center of the room for 2 damage (the timings for each tree are random, so they aren't all synched when they fire), which is absorbed by the crystal when it reaches it. We must hit the crystal to make it turn red. When it's red, the tree's beams bounce off it and go back to the tree to hurt it-- But it reverts to blue again when a beam hits it. Also, whenever we hit the crystal, a vine guard appears in one of the 'arms' of the room. (the dust animation used for Dyssius's legs can be used as the appearing animation)

It takes 3 beam hits per tree to kill it. When all the trees are dead, there is a white flash and the crystal turns red permanently. It constantly fires beams in 4 directions (up, right, down, left), once every second. All we have to do at this point is hit it 8 more times to kill it.
