This file is for collecting notes about the source code as we port the
game. It will be tricky otherwise to remember where things are. At
least at first.

This is the location of the map data structure.

    headers/ll/map_structures.bi:Type map_type


This is the location of the room data structure.

    LL/src/headers/ll/map_structures.bi:Type room_type


This is a candidate for the function which loads .map files.

    src\com\ll_build.bas:434       Function load_mapV

    This function first loads the map's own file name as a String.
    FreeBASIC Strings appear to be formatted as a short little endian
    integer length followed by the characters of the string.

    Then, it loads two four byte integers, also little endian, denoting
    the number of entries, and the number of rooms.

    Then, it loads the tileset filename.

    Next, it is looping over all rooms. They all share the same tilset.

        Load the room's top left x coordinate.
        Load the room's top left y coordinate.
        Load the room's parallax. TODO: Not sure what this is or does.
        If parallax is nonzero, load the parallax image.
        Load the room's dark. TODO: Not sure what this is or does. Palette darken?
        Load the room's teleports count.
        Load the room's song. TODO: Is this an index into a global table of songs?
        Load the room's song_changes. TODO: Not sure what this is or does.
        Load the room's changes_to. TODO: Not sure what this is or does.
        Load the room's reserved. 17 byte structure. TODO: Not sure what this is or does.

This function wraps the above function:

    src\com\ll_build.bas:1203 Function LLSystem_LoadMap


This function is for drawing a room (a sub object of maps?):

    LL/src/com/engine--gfx_LL.bas:942:Sub blit_room() Static
